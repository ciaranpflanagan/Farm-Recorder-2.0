Farm Recorder Beta 2.0 By Ciaran Flanagan

Farm Recorder helps farmers manage their livestock records more efficiently.
Farmers can easily create a database of all the animals on their farm. They can also easily add new born and record
animal sales and purchases. They can note any health treatments. The farmer can then pull this information from the 
cloud wherever he is, at his computer or outside on the farm using our mobile version of the site. This type of quick
and remote access to information is not possible with traditional paper based systems. This web app can eliminates
existing paper based system while at the same time providing much greater savings of time and cost.
